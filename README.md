# REWARDS NETWORK DATA SCIENCE PROBLEMS
Hi <b>Dushyant</b>! Thank you for your interest in joining Data Science at Rewards Network. We are very excited to grow our small but high impact team. We are looking for highly-motivated, perputual learners with a strong desire to deliver value. 2021 is an exciting year for Rewards Network with many new product features and operational changes lined up that will demand Data Science insights and models. Paired with a ripening warehouse containing 30 years of restaurant industry data and a great team atmosphere, we believe Rewards Network offers compelling opportunities for any data enthusiast. We truly are a 30-year-old start-up and we're looking for collaborators that are excited to join a team where they can learn and grow as we do.

This assessment contains three challenges designed to assess not only your technical competancies in Data Science but also you general problem solving skills, business instincts, and data communication techniques. Given the fast pace of innovation at Rewards Network, we strongly believe that efficient insights and actions is much more important than perfect results. Rather than attempting to squeeze out of your models every last percentage point in accuracy, we strongly encourage you to focus on communicating how you break up the problem, why you choose your approach, and how you assess the results. If you found yourself spending hours re-iterating on a model to make it better, you over working the challenge. Instead, lay out a plan, follow it through, and assess the outcome for what it is, good or bad.

- "CHALLENGE 1 - Consumer Behavior Modeling.ipynb"
Assesses your approach to machine learning on a classic problem for Rewards Network: Predicting consumer behavior. Identifying a few key features related to consumer behavior and clearly defining how you will struture your model will be key to success (e.g. is it a classification problem or a time-series problem? both?). 

- "CHALLENGE 2 - A|B Testing Incentives.ipynb"
Aims to assesses your abilty to perform rigorous statistical analysis. Given an uncontrolled experiment to incentivize desired consumer behaviors, how can you confidently assess the impact of the incentive program?

- "CHALLENGE 3 - Math Logic Puzzle.ipynb"
This represents a potentially challenging math problem. We recommend you think about the problem conceptually. Machine learning should not be required. The 

Technical machine learning skills are important, but a general ability to learn and problem solve will allow you to not only apply the tools you already know but also identify new tools that are ideal for any job and gain proficiency with them. As such this problem set is meant to assess not what you already know, but how you approach a new problem. We highly encourage you to search for answers from the web (tutorials, slack overflow, pre built python packages) and reach out us <datascience@rewardsnetwork.com> for guidance or clarification. We appreciate your time and interest and hope you have fun with this problem set.
   
Please be sure to leave all your answers in an easily tractable manner, and push the repo back to GitLab. Show your work in the cells below each problem (adding cells as necessary). Save you deliverables to csv's or pickles. If your logic is subtle add comments to help us understand. If you change approaches consider leaving old code in the notebook but commented out with an explanation why it didn't work. And again please:

1. Don't stress about making a Kaggle worthy model. It's the thought process that matters to us.
2. Reach out if you have any questions or would like guidance on any problems

Sincerely, Data Science @ Rewards Network
