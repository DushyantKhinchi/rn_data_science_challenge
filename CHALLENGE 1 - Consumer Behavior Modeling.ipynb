    "    - gender: encoding of consumer gender as 0 or 1 (labels not important)\n",

    "    - join_dt: the date the consumer joined Rewards Network\n",
    "    - churn_dt: if a consumer formally deletes their account, this is the effective date of that deletion. (We stop tracking their dines after this date, and they recieve no bonuses after this date). Null indicates the consumer is still a member of the program as of Jan \n",
